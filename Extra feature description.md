prayIntelligience function:
  
  
The added extra features to the species mimic their natural evolutionary inclination in the real world animal kingdom. 
In short word, the pay and predator have to have an evolutionary trait specific to their survival need. In consideration 
of demonstrating the real-world scenario in this respect, I have implemented the following functionalities in the simulation.

The pray has been featured with multiple case scenarios to avoid the possible predator attack. The pray analyzes the proximity
of all four dimensions during the presence of a predator(s) and then takes a swift move through the most efficient and less risky path. 
It covers up to 20 edge cases, including the most sophisticated four 90' corners. Depend on the circumstances, the pray performs 
a random escaping turn if there is more than one escaping path detected.


predatorGhosting function:

The fact that the pray becoming evolutionarily smart for survival, I find it quite necessary in adding aggressive characteristics for 
the predator, which offset their outstanding survival skills from one another. The predator has a trait that allows overpowering the 
pray with a condition. The pray present in the predator's detection with a precision of certain distance the predator will lock that 
position and jump to the pray immediately.
